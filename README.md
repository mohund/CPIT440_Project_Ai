# CPIT440 Project AI

## Project Description
This project is developed using Jupyter Notebook to analyze data and implement machine learning models. It focuses on data preprocessing and applying algorithms such as Logistic Regression and Decision Trees.

## Libraries Used
Make sure the following libraries are installed to run the project:
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## Execution Steps
1. **Data Loading**: Load and preprocess the data using the `pandas` library.
2. **Data Analysis**: Display descriptive statistics and visualizations using `seaborn` and `matplotlib`.
3. **Data Splitting**: Split the dataset into training and testing sets using `train_test_split`.
4. **Model Implementation**:
   - Logistic Regression algorithm.
   - Decision Tree algorithm.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Calculate accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix.
